# TeamPerformanceTracker
For this project, I was tasked with designing and developing a full-stack web application using Spring Boot, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, and MySQL. 
It showcases best practices in API development, entity relationships and error handling. 
The project is part of a Cross-Modular Assessment between Web Technologies and Continuous Build &amp; Delivery.
